    "In particular, ciphers designed following the **wide-trail strategy** use the branch number of the linear layer to derive bounds on the probability of linear and differential trails.\n",
    "\n",
    "At FSE 2014, the **LS-design** construction was introduced as a simple and regular structure to design bitsliced block ciphers. It considers the internal state as a bit matrix, and applies alternatively an identical S-Box on all the columns, and an identical L-Box on all the lines.\n",
    "\n",
    "We study the construction of bitsliced linear transformations with **efficient implementations** using XORs and rotations (optimized for bitsliced ciphers implemented on 32-bit processors), and a **high branch number**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main result is a linear layer for 128-bit ciphers with branch number 21, improving upon the best 32-bit transformation with branch number 12, and the one of Spook with branch number 16."

    "We consider an SPN cipher with $\\ell$ parallel SBoxes, each operating on $s$ bits; the block size is $n = \\ell s$ (see Figure 1). In this paper, we denote $\\mathbb{B}_s$ the set of all $s$-bit elements: $B_s = \\{0, 1\\}^s$. The internal state is considered as an element in $B^{\\ell}_s = (\\{0, 1\\}^s)^{\\ell}$, i.e., a sequence of $\\ell$ $s$-bit elements $x = (x_0, x_1, \\dots, x_{\\ell−1})$. We define the Hamming weight of $x$ as $|x| = \\#\\{i \\in \\{0, 1, \\dots , \\ell − 1\\} : x_i \\neq 0\\}$(Hamming weight over $\\mathbb{B}^{\\ell}_s$)."
