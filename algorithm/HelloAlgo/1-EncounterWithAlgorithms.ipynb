    "\n",
    "An algorithm is a set of instructions or steps to solve a specific problem within a finite amount of time. It has the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The problem is clearly defined, including unambiguous definitions of input and output.\n",
    "- The algorithm is feasible, meaning it can be completed within a finite number of steps, time, and memory space.\n",
    "- Each step has a definitive meaning. The output is consistently the same under the same inputs and conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Let's use the math view to explain the algorithm. We start with the origin state and transform it to the target state using a group of operations. Our goal is to minimize the number of operations needed to achieve the target state. This process defines the algorithm."
